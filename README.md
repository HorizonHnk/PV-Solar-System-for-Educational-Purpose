![Project Banner](https://your-image-url-here.jpg)

## 📚 Abstract

This project documents the development of a Photovoltaic (PV) Solar System designed specifically for educational purposes. The system addresses the gap between theoretical renewable energy education and practical application by creating a hands-on learning platform for students. Built over an intensive 2-week development period, this platform enables students to gain practical experience with PV system design, installation, operation, and performance analysis.

The system features monocrystalline solar panels, comprehensive monitoring capabilities through ESP32 microcontrollers, and an interactive web interface for data visualization and analysis. Key components include voltage and current sensors, environmental monitoring, data acquisition systems, and integrated educational content. Testing with student groups confirmed its effectiveness in enhancing understanding of renewable energy concepts and developing technical skills.

## ⚡ Introduction

The increasing global demand for sustainable energy solutions highlights the need for effective educational tools that equip students with practical knowledge of renewable energy systems. Photovoltaic (PV) solar energy is a key technology in the transition towards cleaner power sources, yet many educational institutions lack accessible, hands-on learning resources for students to understand its design, modeling, and implementation.

This project addresses these challenges by designing, modeling, and implementing a PV solar energy system specifically for educational purposes. In an intensive two-week development sprint, I created a scalable, cost-effective, and interactive learning platform that provides students with hands-on experience in renewable energy technologies.
